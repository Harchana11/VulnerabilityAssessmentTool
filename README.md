# Vulnerability Assessment Tool

This project is a Python-based Vulnerability Assessment Tool designed to scan networks for open ports and services, providing a detailed report in PDF format. The tool leverages the power of Nmap to perform comprehensive scans, identifying potential vulnerabilities across all ports (1-65535) on a specified target.

## Features

- **Full Port Range Scanning:** Scans all ports (1-65535) on the specified target.
- **Service Detection:** Identifies the services running on open ports.
- **Version Detection:** If available, the tool also provides the version information of the detected services.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Automatically generates a professional PDF report summarizing the scan results.
- **Privacy Protection:** The tool ensures a report is generated even if no open ports are found or if the host is unresponsive.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Nmap
- FPDF Python Library
